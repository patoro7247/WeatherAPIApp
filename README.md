# Weather API App

This web app takes a user's location, desired temperature and humidity, and email address, and  
will send an email to the user every time the a desired temperature and humidity combination is  
reached in their location(max 1/day).  
I plan to use a weather API app that takes coordinates and returns temperature and humidity,  
at which point I'll have to automate the email sending.
